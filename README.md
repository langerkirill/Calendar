# Calendar

This project is a calendar made with React and Redux. It was bootstrapped with create-react-app.
It allows you to switch months and add reminders to days. The reminders are stored in a Redux 
store. Reminders persist on the page, but not through a refresh. Reminders can be edited, change
colors, and be deleted. I used moment.js for all of the calendar calculations. 

To run this app, clone the project and get to the calendar-app folder of the project in terminal. Then run:

**npm i**

After the packages install, run:

**npm start**

The calendar should open up in a local browser.
