# Calendar

This project is a calendar made with React and Redux. It allows you to switch months and add reminders to days. 
The reminders are stored in a Redux store. Reminders persist on the page, but not through a refresh.
I used moment.js for all of the calendar day calculations. 

To run this app, clone the project and run:

npm i

After an install, run:

npm start

The calendar should open up in a local browser.
